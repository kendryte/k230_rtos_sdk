### üìù Summary

The `rtos-v0.5` release focuses on transitioning the CanMV K230 platform toward **real-time RTOS workflows**. It introduces new drivers, boards, HAL libraries, and debugging infrastructure essential for embedded systems work. This sets the stage for future development with tight real-time constraints and modular software stacks.

We encourage developers working with RT-Thread to upgrade and try out the new platform capabilities.
